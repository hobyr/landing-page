# Project: Landing Page (from The Odin Project)

This project is the last one before heading to learning JavaScript. At
this point, I've learned enough HTML5 and CSS3 to be able to make modern
designs.

This project will showcase such knowledge.

Tech used:
- HTML5
- CSS3/Flexbox
- Git (for commits and version control)
- Vim in Terminal (for code editing)
