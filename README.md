# Project: Creating a Landing Page

This project is the last one before heading to JavaScript on both FreeCodeCamp
and The Odin Project. At this point, I've learned enough HTML5 and CSS3 to be
able to make web page designs.

Tech used:
- HTML5
- CSS3/Flexbox/CSS Grid
- Git (for commits and version control)
- Vim in Terminal (for code editing)
